# Judge0 Frontend

React + Vite single page app for browsing problems, submitting code, and viewing Judge0 evaluation results.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` if the backend API is running on a non-default host/port. During development Vite proxies `/api` calls to the configured backend.

Build for production with `npm run build`.
